This draft hopefully lays out my audio narrative and its story beats in entirety. My audio narrative takes the listeners through a heist's planning and execution,
aiming to steal a medieval dagger at a museum. The first screenshot shows my first steps in establishing the environment, experimenting with the ambient sounds and utilizing
several sounds I recorded myself (the door closing and locking, the lamp turning on, the papers unfurling). The second screenshot shows as much of Audacity as I can fit on my
screen during the climax of the narrative. I've noticed that I've been having a difficult time knowing when sounds are productive when laid over each other and when it's just
more noise. I feel like my soundscape is too linear; the environment itself does not feel fleshed out and just takes the listeners through the sounds of overt actions.
Between now and the final submission date I may experiment with adding more interpretive sounds/foley and think harder about what sounds would be at a museum (I think a
problem may be that I associate museums with quiet).

The next important step for me in this project is to get two other people to say a few lines, as I am currently the placeholder voice for all speaking characters (3 in total).
I'm also a little concerned with how much the narration carries the soundscape; without it, it's almost impossible to know what's happening. I might experiment with removing
lines and letting the environment speak for itself, but I fear that will affect the pacing too much. I also want to work on some more technical aspects of my narrative,
specifically the timing and volume balancing.

Lastly, I think the ending of the piece could be fleshed out much better, but I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure how to describe it, but the audio quality itself (not the
content) feels "low stakes" and I don't know how to filter it to fix that. Maybe add more bass? I'd like it to be a little ambiguous but it doesn't feel final.
