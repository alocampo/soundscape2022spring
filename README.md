This is where Alex Ocampo's audio narrative will live :)

My audio narrative intends to take the listener through the planning meeting of a heist. The narrative will set the scene of a secret meeting, and as the leader of the team begins to describe the plan the soundscape will transition into the real-time actions of the heist. Each step of the plan will be narrated by the leader, and then followed by the accompanying sounds of it getting done. The target of the heist is to steal a medieval dagger, named the Sanguine Fang, from a museum.
