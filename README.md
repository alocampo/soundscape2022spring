<h1>Stealing the Sanguine Fang</h1>
<h2>By Alexander Ocampo</h2>

*Stealing the Sanguine Fang* takes listeners through the heist plans to steal a medieval dagger from a museum. As the team's leader—an esteemed speaker and academic—describes the plan to his crew one last time, the audience is taken into the real-time events of their big day. Can the team pull it off? Or will their plans be cut short? Listen to find out!

This project was created for the University of Pittsburgh's Composing Digital Media class of Spring 2022.
