This is where Alex Ocampo's audio narrative will live :)

My audio narrative intends to take the listener through the planning meeting of a heist. The narrative will set the scene of a secret meeting, and as the leader of the team begins to describe the plan the soundscape will transition into the real-time actions of the heist. Each step of the plan will be narrated by the leader, and then followed by the accompanying sounds of it getting done. I'm not entirely sure what they plan to steal yet, but I think the main setting will be during a museum (not after hours). I would like the narration of the plan to desynchronize from what's actually happening near the end as something goes wrong. Whether it loops around to still being a successful heist depends on how much of this can feasibly fit in the soundscape and how well I can actually resolve the conflict.
